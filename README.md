# Document-Scanner-and-OCR

1) Document Perspective Correction:

Incorporated a four-point transformation algorithm to adjust the perspective of input images, converting skewed or angled documents into a bird's-eye view for better readability and processing.

2) OCR for Text Extraction:

Leveraged Pytesseract to extract textual information from preprocessed images, enabling effective detection of content from scanned or captured documents.

3) Image Preprocessing Pipeline:

Applied techniques like grayscale conversion, thresholding, and median blurring using OpenCV to enhance image clarity and optimize the OCR's performance.

4) Automation and Temporary File Management:

Integrated seamless handling of temporary files and robust workflows for processing images, ensuring smooth execution and efficient text extraction.
